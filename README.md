## Why Markdown and YAML?

Traditionally, to edit a website, one had to write in pure HTML. This was challenging for many website administrators as HTML is not an intuitive language for those who are inexperienced with it.

Our team decided to go with Markdown (.md) – more human readable syntax – so as to empower non-technical website administrators.

While Markdown is appropriate for writing long segments of text, it alone does not allow users to edit small details of the website (e.g. change the hero-banner image) without diving into the HTML.

We therefore chose to supplement the Markdown syntax with YAML (.yml) – yet another human readable syntax.
