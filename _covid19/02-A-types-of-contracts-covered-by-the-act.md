\* The role of an Assessor in these cases is to determine whether the moratorium (i.e. temporary relief from legal and enforcement action) applies. An Assessor’s determination is no longer necessary after the expiry of the prescribed period, as the moratorium automatically lapses when the prescribed period expires. **Pending applications as at the deadline will be deemed withdrawn.** For the avoidance of doubt, pending applications include (i) Applications where the Registrar has not yet appointed an Assessor; and (ii) Applications where an Assessor has been appointed, but that Assessor has not yet made a determination.
