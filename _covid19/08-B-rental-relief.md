<a name="q1">**1.	Why has the Government decided to implement this rental relief framework?** </a><a href="#a1" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	The rental relief framework seeks to help affected SMEs, and specified non-profit organisations (“NPOs”) with their cash flow by providing for the fair handling of their accumulated rental obligations, and a fair sharing of economic hardship due to the impact of COVID-19 among the Government, landlords and tenants. 

*	The Government does not ordinarily intervene in private contracts. However, due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on SMEs, the Government has decided to take targeted and temporary measures to intervene to safeguard the economic structure for the common good. The rental relief measures are necessary to support SMEs and the broader economy, which will in turn help property owners continue to enjoy the stable value of their assets in the longer term. 

*	The framework also applies to specified NPOs that are similarly affected by the economic impact of COVID-19. These are NPOs operating with a clear public benefit to the community, businesses, and society at large. 

<a name="q2">**2.	How many months of rental relief can an eligible SME or NPO tenant (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) obtain?** </a><a href="#a2" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	Eligible SMEs and NPOs which are tenant-occupiers who operate their business in a rented property (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) can receive up to 4 months’ waiver of rent* for qualifying commercial properties (e.g. shops), and up to 2 months’ waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties), comprising the following:

    a)	<u>Rental Relief for eligible SME and NPO tenants (supported by Government assistance)</u>: Eligible tenant-occupiers in qualifying commercial properties and other non-residential properties will receive the rental relief through a waiver of rent from their landlords. Property owners will receive support through the: (a) [Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 announced in the Unity and Resilience Budgets](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Working-out-your-taxes/Property-Tax-Reliefs/#title1); and (b) [Government cash grant announced in the Fortitude Budget](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Property/Government-cash-grant--announced-in-Fortitude-Budget-/). 
    
    Eligible SMEs and NPOs in qualifying commercial properties will receive up to 2 months’ waiver of their rent, and eligible SMEs and NPOs in other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties) will receive up to 1 months’ waiver of their rent. 
    
    b)	<u>Additional Rental Relief for SME and NPO tenants (supported by landlords/ property owners)</u>: Eligible SME and NPO tenant-occupiers who have seen a 35% or more drop in their average monthly gross income due to COVID-19 will receive up to an additional 2 months’ waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties, and up to an additional 1 month’s waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties). 

    For more details on the definitions of property in each category, please refer to [this](/files/rentalreliefframework/categorisation_of_properties.pdf).
    
    *The value of the rent to be waived is based on the contractual rent of the tenant, excluding any maintenance fee and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security.

<a name="q3">**3.	What period does the rental relief cover?**</a><a href="#a3" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	Generally, the Rental Relief covers the first 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and the first month within the period of April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties).

*	For eligible tenant-occupiers which meet the criteria for the Additional Rental Relief, the Additional Rental Relief covers a further 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and a further 1 month within the period of  April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties.

*	In cases where rent has already been paid for the relevant relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.

Note: The rental waivers in the table are applicable in cases where the tenant-occupier occupies the property throughout the relief period. Please refer to the section <a href="#scenario">"Specific scenarios"</a> for details of the application of the rental waivers in cases where the tenant-occupier does not occupy the property throughout the relief period.

<a name="q4">**4.	What are the eligibility criteria for an SME/NPO tenant to qualify for the rental relief?**</a><a href="#a4" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	The rental relief framework, comprising the Rental Relief and the Additional Rental Relief, applies to eligible tenant-occupiers of prescribed properties in qualifying leases or licences that are in writing, or evidenced in writing, which are:
 
    a)	(i) Entered into before 25 March 2020; or (ii) entered into before 25 March 2020 but expired and renewed either automatically or in exercise of a right of renewal in the contract; and 
    
    b)	In force at any time between 1 April and 31 July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and between 1 April and 31 May 2020 for other non-residential (e.g. industrial/office) properties.
    
<u>Rental Relief</u>

*	Tenant-occupiers must fall within one of the following categories to be eligible for Rental Relief:

    a)	Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with not more than S$100 million in annual revenue for the Financial Year 2018 or a later appropriate period where applicable, at the individual or entity level<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>; or
    
    
    b)	The following types of Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) with not more than S$100 million in annual revenue for the Financial Year 2018 or a later appropriate period where applicable, at the entity level:
    
       i. Registered or exempt charities (as provided in the Charities Act);<br>
      ii. Members of the National Council of Social Service;<br>
     iii. National sports associations;<br>
      iv. National disability sports associations;<br>
       v. Specified arts and culture societies; or<br>
      vi. Specified trade associations.<br>

<p><sup id="fn1">1. Under Regulation 2 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020, “entity” means: (a) a specified person; or (b) any of the following (including when acting as a trustee of a trust) that is not a specified person — (i)    a corporation registered under section 19 or 368 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50); (ii) a sole proprietorship; (iii) a partnership (iv) a limited partnership (v) a limited liability partnership; (vi) a co-operative society. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>

<u>Additional Rental Relief</u>

*	The Additional Rental Relief will apply to tenant-occupiers who qualify for Rental Relief, have carried on business at the rented property before 25 March 2020 and meet the following additional criteria:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
 <li><u>For SMEs</u></li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>(Note: this additional criterion is not applicable if the tenant-occupier is a stand-alone company that is not part of any group of companies) Where 50% or more of the total voting shares or power in the tenant-occupier is held by a Singapore-incorporated entity (i.e. it is a subsidiary of another entity incorporated in Singapore) and the tenant-occupier is a member of a Singapore group of entities<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> ("group") during the period 1 April to 31 May 2020, the group's aggregate revenue is not more than S$100 million for the Financial Year 2018 or a later appropriate period where applicable<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>; and</li>
<li>The tenant-occupier suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly gross income at the outlet level for the period 1 April to 31 May 2020, compared to 1 April to 31 May 2019, or alternative periods if the tenant-occupier was not operational as of 1 Apr 2019<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
 <li><u>For NPOs</u>: The tenant-occupier suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly gross income at the entity level for the period 1 April to 31 May 2020, compared to 1 April to 31 May 2019, or alternative periods if the tenant-occupier was not operational as of 1 Apr 2019<sup>4</sup>. </li>
</ol>

<p><sup id="fn2">2. A Singapore group of entities means a group of entities that are incorporated or established in Singapore and which are related through ownership or control in such a way that the group is either required to prepare consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes under FRS 110 or an equivalent standard or would have been so required if equity interests in any of the entities were traded on any stock exchange in Singapore. <a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn3">3. Where none or only one member of the Singapore group of entities has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of the group’s financial year ending on a date in the year 2018, and more than one member of the same group has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of the group’s financial year ending on a date in the year 2019, the reference period will be FY2019 instead. If the foregoing is inapplicable, if more than one member of the Singapore group of entities has carried on business for 12 months or longer as at the last day of the group’s financial year ending in the year 2020 on a date that is on or before 31 March 2020, the reference period will be FY 2020. For any other case, the aggregate average monthly revenue of all members of the group will be extrapolated for comparison against the $100 million revenue threshold. Please refer to Regulation 14 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020 for further details. <a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
<p><sup id="fn4">4. If the tenant-occupier commenced business after 1 April 2019, comparison will be against the period from the date of commencement of business to 24 March 2020 (both dates inclusive) to ascertain the decrease of 35% or more. <a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>

<a name="q5">**5.	What is the definition of “gross income” in the context of the criteria for Additional Rental Relief?**</a><a href="#a5" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* Gross income, in the context of the eligibility criteria for the Additional Rental Relief under Regulation 14 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020, means total revenue minus direct costs (but before indirect costs like overheads and taxes).
 
* In computing gross income, all income derived by the company/NPO, including trade income and separate sources of income, should be taken into account. This would include Government grants, if any.

<a name="q6">**6.	Will intermediary landlords also receive rental waivers if their tenant is an eligible tenant-occupier? What if they do not meet the eligibility criteria for rental relief?**</a><a href="#a6" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	If the eligible tenant-occupier rents the property through an intermediary landlord, all intermediary landlords along the chain will also receive rental waivers in respect of that eligible tenant-occupier for the corresponding period from their immediate landlords, regardless of whether the intermediary landlords meet the eligibility criteria. An intermediary landlord’s entitlement to rental waivers is solely dependent on the tenant-occupier’s eligibility.

<a name="q7">**7.	What happens if the rent which an intermediary landlord collects from his tenant is higher than the rent he pays to his landlord? Will he be required to absorb the difference in granting the rental waivers?**</a><a href="#a8" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	An intermediary landlord will be required to provide a full waiver to their tenant according to the applicable rental relief period.


<a name="q8">**8. Why has the period of April to May 2020 been chosen as the period for determining the 35% drop in gross income – is it possible to choose a different period for comparison? Why is it necessary to compare gross income against the same period year on year? What if a tenant was not operational during the April to May 2019 period – how will the drop in revenue be assessed?**</a><a href="#a8" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	The reason why April to May 2020 is used for the period of comparison is that it corresponds to the period of the Circuit Breaker, and the Additional Rental Relief to be provided by landlords to tenants is intended to provide more help to SME tenants which have been substantially hit by COVID-19. The reason why the same period of time for a year on year comparison is used is to account for seasonal fluctuations in revenue. 

*	Where businesses started operations after 1 Apr 2019 but before 25 Mar 2020, average monthly gross revenue derived from the date the business commenced operations to 24 Mar 2020 is to be compared with the average monthly gross income derived between 1 Apr 2020 and 31 May 2020 to establish a 35% or more drop at the outlet.

* Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that the rental relief framework is intended to establish a baseline position for the handling of tenants’ rental obligations. Landlords and tenants are free to work out mutually agreeable arrangements that best address their specific circumstances.


<a name="q9">**9.	How will the 35% drop in gross income be assessed if there is no revenue-generating activity conducted in the prescribed property?**</a><a href="#a9" title="Return to top">↩</a>   

* The 35% income drop criterion can be assessed by comparing the average monthly gross income derived from that business (or incidental purpose) conducted at the prescribed property for the period 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2020 to the period 1 April 2019 to 31 May 2019. If a tenant-occupier can show that it suffered a 35% or more decrease in its average monthly gross income derived from its business, as attributable to the specific property, it may be eligible for Additional Rental Relief if the other criteria as set out in regulation 14 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020 are met.


<a name="q10">**10.	What does it mean to be an SME as part of a “Singapore group of entities”?**</a><a href="#a10" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	“Singapore group of entities” refers to a group of entities that are incorporated or established in Singapore that is related through ownership or control in such a way that the group is either required to prepare consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes under FRS 110 or an equivalent standard or would have been so required if equity interests in any of the entities were traded on any stock exchange in Singapore. If the SME is a member of a Singapore group of entities in the period 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2020, the group’s annual revenue must be not more than $100 million. 


<a name="expect"><u>What landlords and tenants can expect and should do</u></a><a href="#ref1b" title="Return to top">↩</a>

<a href="#q11" id="a11">11. Are property owners required to serve a copy of the notice of cash grant to their tenants within 4 working days from the date of notice or the date after they receive the hard copy notice of cash grant from IRAS?</a>


<a name="q11">**11. Are property owners required to serve a copy of the notice of cash grant to their tenants within 4 working days from the date of notice or the date after they receive the hard copy notice of cash grant from IRAS?**</a><a href="#a11" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* Property owners are required to serve a copy of the notice of cash grant within 4 working days after they receive the hard copy notice of cash grant from IRAS. For example, a property owner who received on 13 August a notice of cash grant dated 7 August 2020 is required to serve a copy to its tenants by 19 August 2020.


<a name="eligibility"><u>Confirmation of eligibility and dispute resolution</u></a><a href="#ref1d" title="Return to top">↩</a>

<a href="#q12" id="a12">12. What can a landlord do if he is not satisfied that his tenant is eligible for rental relief, or if his tenant refuses to submit the required documents to prove his eligibility? Is the landlord still required to provide the rental waivers in such cases?</a>

<a name="q12">**12.	What can a landlord do if he is not satisfied that his tenant is eligible for rental relief, or if his tenant refuses to submit the required documents to prove his eligibility? Is the landlord still required to provide the rental waivers in such cases?**</a><a href="#a12" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* Rental relief under the Act is triggered when the owner of a prescribed property receives IRAS' notice of cash grant pertaining to their eligible tenant-occupiers. This means eligible tenants do not need to pay rent for the period covered by the Rental Relief Framework. If rent has already been paid, tenants can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, get a refund from their landlords. Landlords have to grant the rental waivers stated in the notice until the tenant is proven ineligible. 

* Where landlords have any doubts as to the eligibility of a tenant-occupier, both parties are encouraged to communicate the reasons and share the necessary information. The owner or the landlord can request, by written notice, the tenant-occupier to provide the relevant information within 5 working days of the request to prove their eligibility for the Rental Relief and/or Additional Rental Relief.

*	If a landlord and tenant-occupier are unable to reach a compromise on whether the tenant-occupier is eligible for Rental Relief and/or Additional Rental Relief, the property owner and/or any intermediary landlord(s) may make an application using the prescribed form [here](/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes#assess) within 10 working days after receiving (a copy of) the notice of cash grant, to have a rental relief assessor ascertain whether the tenant-occupier is eligible for Rental Relief and/or Additional Rental Relief. Please refer to the section [Application for Assessment](/covid19-relief/further-information-on-application-for-assessment) for details. If you require assistance on application matters, you may call the Registry during office hours at 1800-2255-772 (1800-CALL-RRA).

* The assessment process will require the tenant-occupier to provide the documents stipulated in in the Regulations if they were not provided to the landlord earlier. Given this, and as far as possible, we encourage tenants to share the documents with the landlords in a timely fashion. 

<a name="q13">**13. What can a landlord do if his tenant fails to meet the timeline of 5 working days to provide documents to prove his eligibility for rental relief?**</a><a href="#a13" title="Return to top">↩</a> 
 
* We encourage all landlords and tenant-occupiers to strictly adhere to the prescribed timeline to provide the required documents and/or make an application to the assessors to have a dispute determined. In relation to the provision of the required documents, please note that it is an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act for a tenant-occupier not to provide the said documents, without reasonable excuse, within the prescribed timeline. If however, a tenant-occupier fails to provide the said documents within the prescribed time, the landlord is not precluded from filing an application to the rental relief assessors ahead of receiving the said documents.

<a name="q14">**14.	What if the landlord refuses to grant rental waivers under the rental relief framework or imposes conditions for granting the rental waivers? How can tenants ensure that they will receive the rental waivers? Are there any penalties for non-compliance by landlords?**</a><a href="#a14" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	Under the Act, the rent that is payable by eligible tenants to their landlord for the relevant period of rental waiver is statutorily waived once qualifying property owners with eligible tenant-occupiers receive the notice of the cash grant issued by IRAS. This means that as an eligible tenant-occupier you do not need to pay rent for those months. This is a default position – while landlords and tenants are free to come to a mutual agreement which best takes into account their specific circumstances, failing an agreement, the landlord must waive the rent for those months. 
 
*	In the case where tenants have already paid rent for those months for which rent is waived (i.e. for qualifying commercial properties - April and May 2020, and if applicable, June and July 2020; and for other non-residential properties April 2020, and if applicable, May 2020), tenants can apply the rental waivers towards the next most immediate months of rent. If there is insufficient time left in the lease, tenants can obtain a refund from the landlord.

*	Landlords should not impose conditions for granting rental waivers, as contractual provisions which are inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of legislation, such as those for the rental relief framework, will not be given effect.   

<a name="q15">**15.	What should a tenant/ex-tenant do if his landlord does not refund him the rent that he already paid for the months covered under the rental relief framework? What is considered a reasonable timeframe for the landlord to refund the rent?**</a><a href="#a25" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	The Act states that in cases where rent has been paid for the relevant rental relief period, and it is not possible for the rental waivers to be offset from the next most immediate months of rent (e.g. if there is insufficient time remaining under the lease agreement), the landlord must immediately refund the balance. If the landlord does not do so, the Act provides for that amount to be recoverable as a debt due from the landlord to you. As such, we encourage you to work out a mutual agreement with your landlord as far as possible, failing which you may consider commencing legal proceedings to recover that amount.

<a href="#q23" id="a23">23. Can interest be charged on any rental arrears accumulated between the rental relief period?</a>

<a name="q16">**16.	What specific components of the rent will be waived? Do tenants need to continue paying specific components of the rent e.g. maintenance and service fees? Does the rent to be waived include variable rent based on Gross Turnover, and if so, why?**</a><a href="#a16" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	The value of the rent to be waived is based on the contractual rent <b>as agreed upon under the terms of the lease agreement</b>, excluding any maintenance fee and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security. Where the amounts of maintenance and/or service charges are not expressly set out in the lease or licence agreement, landlords and tenants are encouraged to jointly determine the amounts to be excluded based on landlords’ actual expenses, as supported by the necessary documentation.

*	The rent to be waived includes any variable rent, including variable rent based on gross turnover. This is because the intent of the rental relief framework is to provide relief from the payment of rent, which forms a significant part of business costs. However, tenants have to continue paying maintenance fees and service charges as these are costs which are incurred by the landlord for the use and upkeep of the property.

*	In an earlier press release dated 3 June 2020, “New Rental Relief Framework for SMEs”, it was stated that the rental waivers would be based on base rental, excluding any Gross Turnover payable, maintenance fees and charges for the provision of services such as cleaning and security. We have reviewed and adjusted the definition after further consideration.


<a name="q17">**17.	Is GST applicable for the rent that is waived?**</a><a href="#a17" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* There is no GST applicable on the rent that is waived.  However, the rental waived will exclude any maintenance fees and charges (and any GST payable on these charges) for the provision of services such as cleaning and security, which will still be payable to the landlord.


<a name="q18">**18. Is the payment of MCST fees (i.e. contribution to sinking fund and management fund) excluded from the rental waiver?**</a><a href="#a18" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* Yes, the payment of MCST fees (i.e. contribution to the sinking fund and management fund of a property) can be excluded from the rental waivers as these are contributions towards the maintenance and upkeep of the property.


<a name="q19">**19. Can the rental waivers be offset by any waivers or other forms of assistance that a landlord had provided to his tenant prior to the implementation of the Act? What can be considered for the offset, if allowed?**</a><a href="#a19" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	Generally, landlords may offset the rental waivers against any financial assistance previously provided to their tenants, such as: 

    a)	Any payment, or deduction of any amount due under the lease or license agreement, (i) given by the landlord to the tenant on or after 1 February 2020 but before the date of receipt of the copy of the notice of cash grant by the tenant; or (ii) undertaken by the landlord, before the date the notice of cash grant is issued to the property owner, to be given to the tenant; and/or

    b)	Any benefit of the Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 that has been passed on or is obliged to be passed on by the property owner in respect of the property. 

*	Please note that the property owner is still required to provide any remaining rental waiver after taking into account any offsetting as detailed above. 

<a name="q20">**20. What should property owners do if the Government assistance (Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 and Government cash grant) is not equal to the Rental Relief that the tenant is entitled to?**</a><a href="#a20" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* The Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 and Government cash grant provided to property owners are computed based on the Annual Value of the property. Thus, the total amount may not be equivalent to the rental waiver to be provided by property owners, which is based on the contractual rent (excluding maintenance fees and service charges). The Property Tax Rebate and Government cash grant are not intended to cover the full amount of rental waivers exactly. Please see what property owners need to do for each scenario below:

   a) Where the sum of Property Tax Rebate and Government cash grant is **less than** the 2 or 1 month(s) Rental Relief owners are obliged to give, owners are required to top up the difference. 

   b) Where (i) the sum of Property Tax Rebate and Government cash grant is **more than** the 2 or 1 month(s) Rental Relief and (ii) the Property Tax Rebate is **less than** the 2 or 1 month(s) Rental Relief  owners are obliged to give, owners are allowed to keep the excess Government cash grant.

   c) Where (i) the sum of Property Tax Rebate and Government cash grant is **more than** the 2 or 1 month(s) Rental Relief and (ii) the Property Tax Rebate is **more than** the 2 or 1 month(s) Rental Relief  owners are obliged to give, owners are allowed to keep the excess Government cash grant but the excess Property Tax Rebate must be passed on to the tenant in accordance with the Property Tax Rebate scheme.

**Example:** Owner A has a qualifying commercial property (e.g. shop) with Annual Value of $60,000 as determined by IRAS at 13 April 2020. Owner A received (i) Property Tax Rebate of $6,000 (property tax rate of 10% x Annual Value) and (ii) Government cash grant of $4,000 (0.8 x Annual Value / 12). The total Government assistance is $10,000.

**Scenario 1: Owner A rents the shop to an eligible tenant at $5,200 per month (excluding maintenance fees and service charges) during the relief period 1 April to 31 May 2020.** 

Owner A is required to provide rental waivers amounting to $5,200 x 2 = $10,400. The difference of $400 ($10,400 - $10,000) for the months April and May 2020 must be topped up by Owner A. 

**Scenario 2: Owner A rents the shop to an eligible tenant at $4,800 per month (excluding maintenance fees and service charges) during the relief period 1 April to 31 May 2020.**

Owner A is required to provide rental waivers amount to $4,800 x 2 = $9,600. Owner A is allowed to retain the excess cash grant of $400 ($10,000 - $9,600) for the months April and May 2020. 

**Scenario 3: Owner A rents the shop to an eligible tenant below market at $1,000 per month (excluding maintenance fees and service charges) during the relief period 1 April to 31 July 2020.** 

Owner A is required to provide rental waivers amount to $1,000 x 4 = $4,000. Owner A must pass on the excess Property Tax Rebate of $2,000 (Property Tax Rebate of $6,000 less rental waivers of $4,000) to the tenant in accordance with the Property Tax Rebate scheme. Owner A can retain the full cash grant amount of $4,000.


<a name="q21">**21.	Are the rental waivers to tenants given on top of the Property Tax Rebate that landlords are obliged to pass on?**</a><a href="#a32" title="Return to top">↩</a>

* No. Where a property owner has already passed on the Property Tax Rebate to the tenant on or before 31 Jul 2020, the property owner will be treated as also having satisfied its obligation to provide rental waiver under the Rental Relief Framework for the amount of Property Tax Rebate passed on (on or before 31 Jul 2020), and would only have to provide rental waivers on the remaining sum due under the Rental Relief Framework.

* Conversely, where a property owner has satisfied its obligation to provide rental waivers under the Rental Relief Framework, the net amount of rental waiver that has been provided by the property owner under the Rental Relief Framework will also go towards satisfying the property owner’s obligation to pass on the Property Tax Rebate.

* For example: Owner A rents a shop to an eligible tenant, Tenant A, at $5,000 per month (excluding maintenance fees and service charges) during the relief period 1 April to 31 May 2020 (2 months). Owner A received a Property Tax Rebate of $6,000 and passed on $3,000 to Tenant A in July 2020.

* Owner A received a notice of cash grant in August 2020 and is required to provide rental waiver amounting to $5,000 x 2 = $10,000 to Tenant A. Owner A can offset the Property Tax Rebate of $3,000 passed on against the rental waiver of $10,000. Effectively, Owner A needs to provide the net rental waiver of $7,000. After providing the net rental waiver, Owner A is not required to pass on the remaining Property Tax Rebate of $3,000 which is already covered by the net rental waiver of $7,000. 


<a name="q22">**22.	Are landlords allowed to effect their rental waiver through instalments or in part, e.g. to collect less rent for more months which equate in total to the 2 or 4 months of rental waiver?**</a><a href="#a22" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	The Rental Relief covers 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and 1 month within the period of April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties). For tenant-occupiers which meet the criteria for the Additional Rental Relief, the rental relief covers a further 2 months within the period of April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, and a further 1 month in April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties.

*	In cases where rent has already been paid for the relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.

*	However, landlords and tenants are free to come to a mutual agreement on how to effect the rental waiver which best takes into account their specific circumstances. 


<a name="q23">**23.	Can interest be charged on any rental arrears accumulated between the rental relief period?**</a><a href="#a23" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	Under S19H and S19J of the Act, any interest or late charges that have been applied on rental arrears accumulated during the period of rental waiver (i.e. April to July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, or April to May 2020 for other non-residential properties, e.g. office/industrial properties) will also be waived.

*	If there is only 1 eligible tenant-occupier during the rental relief period, the rental relief will apply to the period during which the tenancy subsists. If there is more than 1 eligible tenant-occupier during the rental relief period, the Rental Relief and Additional Rental Relief will be pro-rated accordingly, subject to the tenant-occupiers meeting the criteria for Additional Rental Relief. 

*	However, in cases where rent has already been paid for the relief period, the tenant can either apply the rental waivers to the next immediate month(s) of rent, or if this is not possible, receive a refund from the landlord.

* Tenant occupiers may use the [online rental relief calculator](/files/RentalReliefCalculator-Updated.xlsx) to estimate the rental waivers they are eligible for. 

<a name="q25">**25.	What happens if there are multiple SME tenant-occupiers during the period of rental relief?**</a><a href="#a25" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	If there are multiple SME tenant-occupiers during the period of rental relief, the share of the Rental Relief  (supported by Government assistance) and the Additional Rental Relief will be pro-rated based on the number of days of the tenancy within the period, as a proportion of the period, subject to the tenant-occupiers meeting the criteria for Additional Rental Relief. 

*	For instance, if a landlord of a qualifying commercial property has two eligible tenant-occupiers during the period of rental relief – Tenant A (from 1 Jan to 31 May 2020), and Tenant B (from 1 Jun to 31 July 2020), Tenant A will qualify for 1 month of Rental Relief for the month of April 2020, and 1 month of Additional Rental Relief for the month of May 2020.  Tenant B will qualify for 1 month of Rental Relief for the month of June 2020. Tenant B will not qualify for Additional Rental Relief as this only applies to tenant-occupiers who have carried on business at the rented property before 25 March 2020, and have suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly gross income at the outlet level from April to May 2020 compared to 1 April to 31 May 2019 or alternative periods.

Can this be used to offset the rental waivers to be provided to a subsequent tenant which is eligible for the rental waivers?**</a><a href="#a26" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	Generally, the Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 that has been passed on or is obliged to be passed on by the property owner to earlier tenants in accordance with the relevant laws can be used to offset the rental waivers to be provided to eligible tenants. 


<a name="q27">**27.	If the property ownership changes before IRAS issues the notice of cash grant, will the previous or new owner receive the notice? Assuming the previous owner was the landlord of the eligible tenant during the relief period, should the previous or new owner bear the rental waivers?**</a><a href="#a27" title="Return to top">↩</a>

*	IRAS will issue the notice of cash grant to the prevailing owner at the time of issuance. If the property transfer was completed prior to the notice issuance, the notice will be sent to the new owner. Once the notice is received by the new owner, the rental of the eligible tenant will be treated as waived. 

*	Generally, the rental waivers are to be borne by the landlord of the eligible tenant during the relief period. Where the previous owner was the landlord of the eligible tenant during the relief period, the previous owner should bear the rental waivers. 

*	Where the property was sold mid-way through the rental relief period, the previous and new owners who are landlords of the eligible tenant should bear the rental waivers for their respective relief periods when they were landlords. 

*	The previous and new owners should come to a mutual agreement on how best to distribute the monies received from the Government in the form of the Property Tax Rebate for Year 2020 and the Government cash grant, given the variance in individual circumstances and terms of the sale and purchase transaction.

*	The Government recognises that there are landlords who may face genuine financial hardship.

*	Landlords who meet <u>all</u> the following criteria may apply to a rental relief assessor to reduce the amount of Additional Rental Relief they have to provide:

    a)	The applicant landlord must be an individual or a sole proprietor and is the owner of the prescribed property;

    b)	The aggregate of the annual value of all investment properties (including the prescribed property) owned (whether solely or jointly with another person and whether directly or through one or more investment holding companies) is not more than S$60,000 as at 13 April 2020; and

    c)	The rental income derived from all the properties that the landlord must provide Additional Rental Relief for in Year of Assessment 2019 or a later appropriate period<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>  constituted 75% or more of the landlord’s gross income in that period.

*	If the landlord meets the grounds of financial hardship above, the rental relief assessor may halve the amount of Additional Rental Relief to be borne by the landlord, i.e. one month’s rental waiver for qualifying commercial properties, or half a month’s rental waiver for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties).

    b)	If IRAS’ notice of cash grant, or copy of the notice, is received after 30 September 2020: Submit application within 10 working days after receiving the notice. For example, if the notice is received on 1 October 2020, the application should be submitted by 15 October 2020.

<a name="q40">**40.	What are some examples of disputes which cannot be determined by a rental relief assessor?**</a> <a href="#a40" title="Return to top">↩</a>

Rental relief assessors cannot make a determination on disputes over the following matters:

* **Disputes over the type of property:** The quantum of rental waivers are based on the approved and actual use of the property. If the approved and actual use of the property is different, please inform IRAS to review the assessment of the property and to grant the corresponding Property Tax Rebate and cash grant.

* **Non-rent issues, e.g. inability to vacate or reinstate premises, lease termination:** Landlords and tenants should negotiate and come to a mutual agreement on such matters.

* **Landlords imposing new contractual terms as condition to provide waivers:** Eligible tenants do not have to pay rent (excluding maintenance and service fees) for the relevant months. Landlords should not impose conditions for granting rental waivers, as contractual provisions which are inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of legislation, such as those for the rental relief framework, will not be given effect.

* **Whether tenants must pay maintenance and service fees:** Eligible tenants must pay maintenance and service fees for the relevant months.
