#### Step 1: Claimant serves Notice of Negotiation ####
An eligible party  <hyperlink to (1) Key Features of Re-Align Framework> to the contract who wishes to renegotiate or terminate the contract must serve a Notice of Negotiation (“the Claimant”) within **6 weeks** from 14 December 2020 **(i.e. by 25 January 2021)**, on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:
* Any other party to the contract (“the Counterparty”). 
* The Claimant’s guarantor or surety, or the issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract.
* Any assignee of any party to the contract.  
  
<u>Service by the electronic system</u>

To serve the Notice of Negotiation using the electronic system, you **<u>must have</u>** an email address, as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):
*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link*   (CorpPass).
*	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link*   (SingPass).

<u>Service by other modes if you are unable to use the electronic system</u>

Only if you are unable to serve the Notice of Negotiation using the electronic system, please download the Notice of Negotiation* and serve the form using [other modes of service](other-modes-of-service).
***IMPORTANT NOTE: This form will only be available for download from 14 December 2020 onwards.** 

<u>Changes to Notice of Negotiation</u>

You should ensure that the contents of the Notice of Negotiation are correct. You will not be able to change the contents of the Notice of Negotiation once it is served. If you made an error in the Notice of Negotiation that you served on the Recipient(s), you will need to withdraw it by serving a Notice of Withdrawal and then serve a new Notice of Negotiation (which must be done by 25 January 2021).

##### Moratorium #####
To facilitate negotiations and to avoid parallel proceedings on the same matter, once a Claimant serves a Notice of Negotiation, the Counterparty will be prohibited from taking legal and enforcement actions (e.g. court and arbitration proceedings, or termination of the contract) against the Claimant for his failure to perform any contractual obligation due to be performed from the day the Notice of Negotiation is served. 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Counterparty is not prohibited from taking legal and enforcement actions in relation to the Claimant’s failure to perform any contractual obligations due to be performed before the day the Notice of Negotiation is served (e.g. outstanding rent). 

Broadly, the prohibition will end on the earliest of the following: 

(a)	On the expiry of 8 weeks after the Notice of Negotiation is served, if no other Notices including the Notice of Objection are served and lodged; 

(b)	If some other Notice (such as a Notice of Objection) has been validly served and lodged, 

  (i)	The day the Notice of Negotiation is withdrawn; 

  (ii)	The day the only or last Notice for Adjustment is withdrawn; 

  (iii)	The day the Notice of Compensation is withdrawn, if no Notice of Objection or no Notice for Adjustment are served and lodged; 

  (iv)	Where the adjustment relief Registrar determines that no adjustment relief assessor needs to be appointed; 

  (v)	The day on which an Assessor has made all the determination required to be made in relation to the Notice of Negotiation. 

For more details on the moratorium, please refer to the [Fifth Schedule of the Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/37-2020/Published/20201116?DocDate=20201116){_target="_blank"}.  


#### Step 2: Claimant and Counterparty renegotiate contract during 4-week Negotiation Period ####
From the date of the Notice of Negotiation, there will be a **4-week Negotiation Period** during which the Claimant and the Counterparty are encouraged to renegotiate the terms of the contract or to renegotiate the terms of termination of the contract, where applicable. 

During this **4-week Negotiation Period**, the Counterparty cannot file a Notice of Objection. 

#### Step 3: Counterparty lodges and serves Notice of Objection and/or Notice of Compensation during the 2-week Objection Period ####

At the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, the two possible outcomes are: 
* Parties have successfully renegotiated the terms of their contract. 
* Parties have been unsuccessful in their renegotiation of the terms of their contract. 

A **2-week Objection Period** starts after the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**. 

If parties have successfully renegotiated the terms of their contract by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, they may proceed with the amended terms of their contract or terminate the contract on their own terms. The Counterparty does not need to serve a Notice of Objection in this situation. 

In contrast, where parties are unsuccessful in their renegotiation by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, there are three courses of action for the Counterparty or his assignee: 

##### (A) Counterparty objects to Claimant’s eligibility for relief #####
If the Counterparty or his assignee wishes to dispute the Claimant’s eligibility for relief under the Framework, within the **2-week Objection Period**, he must serve a Notice of Objection on the required parties and lodge the Notice of Objection with the Adjustment Relief Registrar. 

The Counterparty or his assignee may <u>only</u> object to the Claimant’s Notice of Negotiation on any one or more of the following grounds:
* The contract in question is not a specified contract or is a contract of national interest.
* The Claimant does not satisfy the eligibility criteria for relief.
* The Notice of Negotiation was not served in accordance with section 45 of the Act.

To object to the Notice of Negotiation, the Counterparty must lodge the Notice of Objection with the Registrar and serve the Notice of Objection **<u>within the 2-week Objection Period</u>** on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:
* The Claimant.
* Any other party to the contract; 
* The Claimant’s a guarantor or surety, or issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract; and
* Any assignee of any party to the contract.

The following documents must be attached to the Notice of Objection:
* A copy of the Notice of Negotiation and all documents which were enclosed to the Notice of Negotiation. 
* All supporting documents to support the Counterparty’s Reasons for objecting to the Claimant’s eligibility under the Re-Align Framework.

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u> 

To submit to the Registrar and serve the **Notice of Objection** on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you **<u>must have</u>** an email address, as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):
* If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
* If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass). 

***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

If the Counterparty or his assignee has served a Notice of Objection within the **2-week Objection Period, Step 4** is not applicable. You may refer to **Step 5** below on the steps after a Notice of Objection is served and lodged.

##### (B) Counterparty is a landlord who wishes to seek compensation from the Claimant #####
Where the Claimant is a tenant who has served a Notice of Negotiation on his landlord and the landlord is an [eligible landlord] <hyperlink to (1) Key Features of Re-Align Framework> who wishes to seek compensation from the tenant for its termination of the contract under the Framework, the landlord must within the **2-week Objection Period**, lodge the Notice of Compensation with the Registrar and serve the Notice for Compensation within the **2-week Objection Period** on the following Recipient(s), where applicable: 
•	The tenant who served the Notice of Negotiation; and
•	Any other parties to the lease or licence, including any other landlords or any other tenants. 

**Note**: The **2-week Objection Period** is the same period in which the Landlord must lodge and serve the Notice of Objection, if applicable. 

* If the landlord wishes to dispute the tenant’s eligibility for relief but at the same time wishes to obtain compensation from the tenant if the contract is ultimately terminated, the landlord must lodge and serve both a Notice of Objection and a Notice for Compensation within the **2-week Objection Period**. 
* Similarly, if a landlord does not dispute the tenant’s eligibility for relief but wishes to obtain compensation from the tenant, the landlord must lodge and serve a Notice for Compensation within the **2-week Objection Period**. 

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u> 
To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice for Compensation on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you **<u>must have</u>** an email address, as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):
•	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link*   (CorpPass).
•	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link*   (SingPass). 
***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

##### (C) Counterparty does not object to Claimant’s eligibility for relief #####
Where the Counterparty accepts that the Claimant is eligible for relief under the Framework, he does <u>not</u> need to serve and lodge a Notice of Objection. If no Notice of Objection is served and lodged during the **2-week Objection Period**, the contract is deemed terminated **<u>2 days</u>** after the end of the 2-week Objection Period or on a date agreed between all the parties to the contract. 
If the parties are unable to agree on the terms of termination under the contract, please refer to **Step 4** below regarding the lodgment and service of the Notice for Adjustment after the end of the **2-week Objection Period** in this situation. 

#### Step 4: Either Claimant, Counterparty or Counterparty’s assignee lodges and serves Notice for Adjustment ####
Where no Notice of Objection was served and lodged during the **2-week Objection Period**, the contract is deemed terminated 2 days after the end of the **2-week Objection Period** or on a date agreed between all the parties to the contract. The default terms of termination under the Framework (in Part 4 of the Second Schedule) apply to the termination of the contract. Please refer to here <hyperlink to PDF of infographic for default consequences> for more information. 
  
If the parties do not agree with the default terms and are unable to agree on the terms of termination between themselves, the Claimant, the Counterparty or the Counterparty’s assignee may seek an Assessor’s determination on the adjustment of rights and obligations under the contract on a just and fair basis. 

To seek the Assessor’s determination, **within 2 weeks after the end of the 2-week Objection Period**, the Claimant, the Counterparty or the Counterparty’s assignee must lodge the Notice for Adjustment with the Registrar and serve the Notice for Adjustment on the following Recipient(s), where applicable: 
* Any other party to the contract.
* Any person who is a guarantor or surety, or who has issued a performance bond, in relation to the obligations of the Claimant. 
* Any assignee of any party to the contract. 

The Notice for Adjustment must be accompanied by the following documents:
* A copy of the Notice of Negotiation and all documents which were enclosed to the Notice of Negotiation.
* All supporting documents to support the proposal for adjustment of the rights and obligations under the contract. 

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u> 
To submit to the Registrar and serve the **Notice for Adjustment** on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you **<u>must have</u>** an email address, as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):
* If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link*(CorpPass).
* If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).

***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

#### Step 5: Registrar reviews Notice of Objection / Notice of Compensation / Notice for Adjustment ####
The Registrar will review the Notice of Objection / Notice of Compensation / Notice for Adjustment. 

If the Registrar is satisfied that the Notice of Objection / Notice for Adjustment / Notice for Compensation is in order, the Registrar will send to the Claimant, the Counterparty and their assignees by <u>way of email</u>:

* An acknowledgment of receipt of the Notice of Objection / Notice for Adjustment / Notice for Compensation, as the case may be.
* A notice of the appointment of one or more Assessors.
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.

If the Registrar refuses to accept lodgment of a Notice of Objection or the Notice of Objection is withdrawn by the Counterparty, the contract is deemed terminated. If a determination is required to be made by an Adjustment Relief Assessor on the adjustment of the rights and obligations of the parties and their assignees upon a termination, the Registrar will send to the Claimant, the Counterparty and their assignees **by way of email**:

* A notice of the appointment of one or more Assessors to make a determination on the adjustment of rights and obligations.
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.
 
#### Step 6: Assessor Conducts Hearing and Makes Determination ####
<U>Where Notice of Objection and/or Notice of Compensation is lodged</u>

Where the Counterparty or his assignee has lodged a Notice of Objection and/or Notice of Compensation and they are acknowledged by the Registrar, the Registrar will appoint an Assessor(s) to first make a determination on: 

* The Claimant’s eligibility for relief under the Framework and the date of termination of the contract if the Claimant is eligible (in respect of a Notice of Objection) and/or 
* The landlord’s eligibility for the compensation and the amount of compensation (in respect of a Notice of Compensation), without making a determination on the adjustment of rights and obligations under the contract. 

After the determination(s) on the above issues have been made, if the Claimant is determined to be eligible and the contract is terminated, the parties are encouraged to negotiate and agree on the adjustment of rights and obligations under the contract. If an agreement is reached, the parties should inform the Registrar **<u>within 7 days</u>** from the date of the determination(s). 

If the Registrar does not hear from the parties **<u>within 7 days</u>** from the date of the determination(s), the Registrar will proceed to appoint Assessor(s) to make a determination on the adjustment of rights and obligations of the parties and their assignees upon the termination of the contract. 

<u>Where no Notice of Objection and/or Notice of Compensation, and only Notice for Adjustment is lodged</u>
Where the Counterparty or his assignee has not lodged a Notice of Objection and/or Notice of Compensation and only a Notice for Adjustment is lodged, the Registrar need not appoint an Assessor to make a determination on the Claimant’s  eligibility for relief under the Framework and the date of termination of the contract. Instead, the Registrar will appoint an Assessor to make a determination on the adjustment of rights and obligations of the parties and their assignees upon the termination of the contract under the Framework. 

<u>Mode of hearing</u>
The hearing will generally be conducted <u>over email</u>. The Assessor(s) may request for clarifications or further documents by email.
If the Assessor(s) is of the opinion that the interest of justice would be better served by an <u>online or physical hearing</u>:
* Online hearings will be conducted via Webex.
* Physical hearings will be held at a venue to be advised by the Registrar.

Please note for online or physical hearings:
*	The Assessor(s) may permit a party to be accompanied by an interpreter at the hearing. The party will be responsible for sourcing their own interpreter.
*	No party may be represented by an advocate and solicitor at proceedings before Assessor(s).

If a party to a determination is <u>absent</u> from the hearing, the Assessor(s) may deem that the party (or that party’s assignee who was absent) has withdrawn the Notice lodged by him; or make a determination on the case.

If the party had a good reason for being absent, they may make an application to set aside the determination made in their absence. See [here]() <hyperlink to (6) Assessor’s Determinations>


#### Step 7: Registrar Informs Claimant and Counterparty of Assessor’s Determination ####
After the Assessor(s) has made a determination, the Registrar will inform the Claimant, the Counterparty and their assignees. 

There is no appeal against an Assessor’s determination, and it will be binding on all parties to the contract and their assignees.

The Registrar may publish the facts of the case, the arguments and the determination without disclosing the names of the parties concerned or any information that may disclose their identities.

##### Withdrawal of Notice of Negotiation, Notice of Objection to Notice of Negotiation, Notice for Adjustment and Notice of Compensation #####
Where any party who has lodged and served Notice of Negotiation*, Notice of Objection to Notice of Negotiation, Notice for Adjustment or Notice of Compensation wishes to withdraw that Notice, that party must lodge a Notice of Withdrawal with the Registrar, and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the following Recipient(s) where applicable. 

|Type of Notice you are withdrawing | Recipient(s) on whom you must serve Notice of Withdrawal
| Notice of Negotiation <br>(s 48(1)) | - All the other parties to the contract; and <br>- Any assignee to any party to the contract. 
| Notice of Objection <br>(s 48(3)) | - The party who served the Notice of Negotiation on you; <br>-The other parties to the contract; and <br>- Any assignee to any party to the contract. 
| Notice of Adjustment <br>(s 48(4)) | - The other parties to the contract; and <br>- Any assignee to any party to the contract. 
| Notice of Compensation <br>(s 52) | - The party who served the Notice of Negotiation on you; and<br>- The other parties to the contract. 

(*If you have served a Notice of Negotiation and wish to withdraw the Notice, and if the other party or its assignee has not lodged a Notice of Objection with the Registry, you only need to serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the other party and its assignee, and you do not need to submit the Notice of Withdrawal of the Notice of Negotiation to Registry.)

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u> 
To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you <u>must have</u> an email address, as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):

* If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
* If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).
***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

Please note if you have filed and/or served more than one Notice of Negotiation, Notice of Objection to Notice of Negotiation, Notice for Adjustment or Notice of Compensation, you must lodge and serve the Notice of Withdrawal for <u>each</u> of the Notices you wish to withdraw.
