#### Step 1: Claimant serves Notice of Negotiation ####
An eligible party  <hyperlink to (1) Key Features of Re-Align Framework> to the contract who wishes to renegotiate or terminate the contract must serve a Notice of Negotiation (“the Claimant”) within 6 weeks from 14 December 2020 (i.e. by 25 January 2021), on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:
* Any other party to the contract (“the Counterparty”). 
* The Claimant’s guarantor or surety, or the issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract.
* Any assignee of any party to the contract.  
  
<u>Service by the electronic system</u>

To serve the Notice of Negotiation using the electronic system, you must have an email address, as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):
*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link*   (CorpPass).
*	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link*   (SingPass). 

***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

To register for a SingPass or CorpPass, please visit [https://www.singpass.gov.sg](https://www.singpass.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} or [https://www.corppass.gov.sg](https://www.corppass.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}, respectively. 

<u>Service by other modes if you are unable to use the electronic system</u>

Only if you are unable to serve the Notice of Negotiation using the electronic system, please download the Notice of Negotiation* and serve the form using [other modes of service].
***IMPORTANT NOTE: This form will only be available for download from 14 December 2020 onwards.** 

<u>Changes to Notice of Negotiation</u>
You should ensure that the contents of the Notice of Negotiation are correct. You will not be able to change the contents of the Notice of Negotiation once it is served. If you made an error in the Notice of Negotiation that you served on the Recipient(s), you will need to withdraw it by serving a Notice of Withdrawal and then serve a new Notice of Negotiation (which must be done by 25 January 2021).

##### Moratorium #####
To facilitate negotiations and to avoid parallel proceedings on the same matter, once a Claimant serves a Notice of Negotiation, the Counterparty will be prohibited from taking legal and enforcement actions (e.g. court and arbitration proceedings, or termination of the contract) against the Claimant for his failure to perform any contractual obligation due to be performed from the day the Notice of Negotiation is served. 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Counterparty is not prohibited from taking legal and enforcement actions in relation to the Claimant’s failure to perform any contractual obligations due to be performed before the day the Notice of Negotiation is served (e.g. outstanding rent). 

Broadly, the prohibition will end on the earliest of the following: 

(a)	On the expiry of 8 weeks after the Notice of Negotiation is served, if no other Notices including the Notice of Objection are served and lodged; 

(b)	If some other Notice (such as a Notice of Objection) has been validly served and lodged, 

(ii)	The day the Notice of Negotiation is withdrawn; 

(iii)	The day the only or last Notice for Adjustment is withdrawn; 

(iv)	The day the Notice of Compensation is withdrawn, if no Notice of Objection or no Notice for Adjustment are served and lodged; 

(v)	Where the adjustment relief Registrar determines that no adjustment relief assessor needs to be appointed; 

(vi)	The day on which an Assessor has made all the determination required to be made in relation to the Notice of Negotiation.
