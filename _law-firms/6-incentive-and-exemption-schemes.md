### **Exemption Schemes**

##### **Tax Exemption for Non-Resident Arbitrators**

This tax exemption is applicable to all non-resident arbitrators who are appointed for any arbitration proceedings governed by the Arbitration Act or the International Arbitration Act, or would have been governed by either of those Acts had the venue of arbitration been in Singapore.

For more details, please refer to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore’s (“IRAS”) website.

##### **Tax Exemption for Non-Resident Mediators**

This is a broad-based tax exemption on the income derived by a qualifying non-resident individual for mediation services rendered in Singapore, including services that were rendered in Singapore pursuant to an agreement to mediate specifying Singapore as the venue for the mediation.  A qualifying non-resident individual has to be either a (a) certified mediator; or (b) mediator conducting a mediation administered by a designated mediation service provider.
