#### Summary of Process ####

#### Step 1: Applicant sends a Request for Mediation ####

**Note**: The Request for Mediation and the relevant email address to which the Request should be submitted will be made available on this webpage on 14 July 2021.

Mediation is a voluntary process – both parties have to agree to refer their case to mediation.
* If parties have agreed to mediate at the MCMP at the outset, either party (the “Applicant”) should fill up the Request for Mediation (hyperlink). The Applicant should email (i) the completed Request, (ii) a copy of the wedding contract and (iii) supporting document(s) of parties’ agreement to mediate to MinLaw. All other parties to the contract (including the counterparty to the contract) should be copied in the email. 

* If parties have not agreed to mediate at the MCMP at the outset, the party who wishes to initiate mediation (the “Applicant”) should fill up the Request for Mediation (hyperlink). The Applicant should email (i) the completed Request, and (ii) a copy of the wedding contract to MinLaw. All other parties to the contract should be copied. MinLaw will invite the other party to respond on whether he or she agrees to mediate. If there is no agreement, mediation will not be arranged. Parties will have to resolve their dispute through other ways. 

The deadline to submit a Request for Mediation is **10 September 2021**.
