#### (A)	General ####
1.	Why should I agree to mediation? 

* The Heightened Alert imposed a number of restrictions to manage the risks of COVID-19 transmission through large gatherings. As a result of these restrictions, some wedding solemnisations and receptions during the affected period could not proceed on the scale or in the exact manner that couples and vendors had planned. Adjustments to the wedding plans had to be made to comply with the restrictions.

* This means that some wedding contracts could not be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions that the parties had agreed to. For example, wedding receptions were not allowed from 16 May 2021 to 11 July 2021.  

* In such a case, it is not always clear what the contractual position of the parties would be.  Even if the contract provided for a cancellation fee, it is not clear cut that the event was cancelled since the event could not proceed due to the restrictions even if the couple wanted to. Moreover, the restrictions applied equally to the vendors, such that the vendor could not have put up the reception that that it had agreed to under the contract.

* (Note: Affected parties should seek independent legal advice on their contract, if necessary. Their legal position will depend on the facts of their individual case.)

* Claims for refunds of deposits or attempts to impose cancellation fees are therefore not clear cut and can lead to time-consuming disputes.  In most cases, parties are more interested in moving on – the couples prefer to carry on with their marriage if possible, and wedding vendors (many of whom have already suffered a drop in revenue due to the pandemic) hope to carry out the contract without suffering further financial losses that might threaten the sustainability of their business and the livelihoods of their employees.

* If the matter is not resolved, parties would have to carry out dispute resolution in accordance with their contract.  In many instances, this means making a claim in court.  This will take time, effort and money, all of which could be avoided through negotiation and settlement. 

* In many cases, parties may be unable to reach an agreement as the matter is an emotional one for them.  

* Mediation helps by introducing an independent third party who assists parties to consider their positions objectively, and to find common ground.  Mediators help parties to consider different ways of compromise to fit the parties’ situation.  Unlike litigation, there is no “winning” or “losing” party. The outcome is one which is mutually acceptable to all parties.  

* Finally, mediation is faster and cheaper than litigation in court. Additionally, the entire process and the outcome are confidential.

* MinLaw therefore urges parties affected by COVID-19 to consider mediation to resolve their outstanding issues.
