1.	Why should I agree to mediation? 

* The Heightened Alert imposed a number of restrictions to manage the risks of COVID-19 transmission through large gatherings. As a result of these restrictions, some wedding solemnisations and receptions during the affected period could not proceed on the scale or in the exact manner that couples and vendors had planned. Adjustments to the wedding plans had to be made to comply with the restrictions.

* This means that some wedding contracts could not be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions that the parties had agreed to. For example, wedding receptions were not allowed from 16 May 2021 to 11 July 2021.  

* In such a case, it is not always clear what the contractual position of the parties would be.  Even if the contract provided for a cancellation fee, it is not clear cut that the event was cancelled since the event could not proceed due to the restrictions even if the couple wanted to. Moreover, the restrictions applied equally to the vendors, such that the vendor could not have put up the reception that that it had agreed to under the contract.

* (Note: Affected parties should seek independent legal advice on their contract, if necessary. Their legal position will depend on the facts of their individual case.)

* Claims for refunds of deposits or attempts to impose cancellation fees are therefore not clear cut and can lead to time-consuming disputes.  In most cases, parties are more interested in moving on – the couples prefer to carry on with their marriage if possible, and wedding vendors (many of whom have already suffered a drop in revenue due to the pandemic) hope to carry out the contract without suffering further financial losses that might threaten the sustainability of their business and the livelihoods of their employees.

* If the matter is not resolved, parties would have to carry out dispute resolution in accordance with their contract.  In many instances, this means making a claim in court.  This will take time, effort and money, all of which could be avoided through negotiation and settlement. 

* In many cases, parties may be unable to reach an agreement as the matter is an emotional one for them.  

* Mediation helps by introducing an independent third party who assists parties to consider their positions objectively, and to find common ground.  Mediators help parties to consider different ways of compromise to fit the parties’ situation.  Unlike litigation, there is no “winning” or “losing” party. The outcome is one which is mutually acceptable to all parties.  

* Finally, mediation is faster and cheaper than litigation in court. Additionally, the entire process and the outcome are confidential.

* MinLaw therefore urges parties affected by COVID-19 to consider mediation to resolve their outstanding issues.


#### (B) Qualification Criteria ####
2.	Who does the MinLaw COVID-19 (Wedding) Mediation Programme (“MCMP”) apply to? 
* The MCMP applies to:
  * Contracts related to a wedding event – E.g. Contract with hotel for a wedding banquet, contract for wedding catering services, contract for wedding photography services or make-up services, or, contract for bridal gown.
  * Where the wedding event was scheduled to be held on a date between 8 May 2021 and 31 July 2021 (both dates inclusive).

* Interested parties must submit a Request for Mediation by **10 September 2021**. Please refer to “[Steps in the Mediation Process](steps-in-the-mediation-process)” to find out how to apply for mediation.


3.	Does the MCMP apply to contracts relating to non-wedding events? 
* No. The MCMP only applies to wedding contracts. 
* If your contract is for a non-wedding event, we encourage you to continue negotiating with your counterparty, to come to a mutually acceptable solution. If you believe that a mediator would be helpful in facilitating a solution, you may wish to consider mediation under the [Law Society Mediation Scheme](https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/for-lawyers/dispute-resolution-schemes/law-society-mediation-scheme/), or mediation at the [Singapore Mediation Centre](http://www.mediation.com.sg).

4. How would mediation affect any previous agreements that were reached?
* If both parties agree to the mediation and reach a new settlement agreement at the mediation, the new settlement agreement will override the previous agreement.
* If the parties do not agree to mediation, or if no new settlement is reached during the mediation, the previous agreement will still stand.  


5.	I have an Assessor’s determination, but disagree with it. Can I mediate the dispute under the MCMP? 
* A determination made by an Assessor under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act is binding on parties. 

* However, if both parties are agreeable, parties are not precluded from reaching a further settlement, whether through direct negotiation or mediation. 

* The parties may mediate under the MCMP only if: 
<br>
(1)	Both parties agree to mediation;
<br>
(2)	The contract is for the provision of goods or services for a wedding event; and
<br>
(3)	The wedding event was scheduled to take place on a date between 8 May 2021 and 31 July 2021 (both dates inclusive).
<br>
* Please note that your counterparty is at liberty to decline to attend mediation, and enforce the determination.


#### (C) The Mediators ####

6.	Who are the mediators? 

* The mediators are professionals from various backgrounds, and they include lawyers, managers, business owners and community leaders. They are trained in, and have vast experience in voluntary and Court-referred mediations. 

#### (D) The Mediation Process ####

**Pre-Mediation**
7.	How much does mediation under the MCMP cost?

* Mediation under the MCMP is free.

8.	The Safe Management Measures permit the holding of my wedding event.  Should I nevertheless cancel my wedding event and request for mediation under the MCMP?

* The mediation process is voluntary and may only take place if both parties agree to mediate. Further, for a settlement to take place, both parties must reach an agreement. No settlement will be imposed by the mediator. 

* If the vendor declines to attend mediation, or no agreement is reached during the mediation, the existing contract between the parties, including any contractual provisions for forfeiture of the deposit and charging of cancellation fees, remain binding. You may wish to seek legal advice on your contractual obligations.   

* Parties should consider carefully whether they wish to proceed with their event as originally contracted (especially when they are able to), or would like to attempt to negotiate with their vendor for alternative arrangements (in which case the MCMP is one platform parties can use).


9. The other party does not wish to attend mediation. What can I do?  

* Mediation is a voluntary process – both parties have to agree to mediate. 

* If the other party had previously rejected your proposal for mediation, you may nevertheless make another attempt to initiate a mediation under the MCMP by sending a Request for Mediation to the Ministry of Law, copying the other party. The other party will then be able to re-consider your request for mediation, and will be asked to respond on whether he or she agrees to mediate under the MCMP.  

* If the other party continues to decline mediation, a mediation cannot be arranged. We encourage you to continue negotiating with your counterparty outside of the MCMP, to come to a mutually acceptable solution.

* Otherwise, either party can apply to the Courts to resolve their dispute. If you wish to seek legal advice on your contractual dispute, you can refer to [https://go.gov.sg/legal-asst](https://go.gov.sg/legal-asst) for avenues of legal assistance.
