#### <a name="step1">Step 1: Affected Business serves Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest</a> <a href="#s1" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

An **[eligible party](/realign/key-features#1eligiblity)** to a [Contract of National Interest](/realign/process-essential-services) who wishes to renegotiate the price of the contract must serve a Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest (“the Affected Business”) on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:

* Any other party to the contract (“the Other Party”).
* The Affected Business’ guarantor or surety, or the issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Affected Business’ obligations under the contract.
* Any assignee of any party to the contract.  

The **Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest** must be served by the later of: 

(a) 4 weeks from the date of issuance of the certificate by the Relevant Portfolio Minister to the Affected Business; or
(b) 26 February 2021. 

**<u>Service by the electronic system</u>**

To serve the Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest using the electronic system, you must have an email address as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):

#### <a name="step2">Step 2:  Affected Business and Other Party renegotiate contract during 4-week Negotiation Period</a> <a href="#s2" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

After the service of the Notice of Negotiation for Contract for National Interest, there will be a **4-week Negotiation Period** commencing after the date of the Notice of Negotiation for Contract for National Interest during which the Affected Business and the Other Party are encouraged to renegotiate the price of the contract.

During this Negotiation Period, the Other Party cannot lodge or serve a Notice for Repricing. 

#### <a name="step3">Step 3: End of Negotiation Period and Start of Repricing Period<a name="step1"> <a href="#s3" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

At the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, the two possible outcomes are:

* Parties have successfully renegotiated the price of their contract.
* Parties have been unsuccessful in their renegotiation of the price of their contract. 

A **2-week Repricing Period** starts after the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**.

If parties have successfully renegotiated the price of their contract by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, they may proceed with the amended price of their contract. The Affected Business does not need to serve a Notice for Repricing in this situation. 

In contrast, where parties are unsuccessful in their renegotiation by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period** and Affected Business wishes to seek a repricing of the contract, the Affected Business must, within the **2-week Repricing Period** lodge the Notice for Repricing with the Adjustment Relief Registrar, and serve a Notice for Repricing within the same period on the following Recipient(s), where applicable: 

* The Other Party.
* Any other party to the contract;
* The Affected Business’ guarantor or surety, or issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Affected Business’ obligations under the contract; and
* Any assignee of any party to the contract. 

**<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u>**

To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice for Repricing on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system (if you have an email address, and have the email address(es) of the Recipient(s)):

*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
*	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).

#### <a name="step4">Step 4: Case proceeds to an Assessor</a> <a href="#s4" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

The Registrar will review the Notice for Repricing.

If the Registrar is satisfied that the Notice for Repricing is in order, the Registrar will send to the Affected Business, the Other Party and their assignees by way of email:

* An acknowledgment of receipt of the Notice for Repricing.
* A notice of the appointment of one or more Assessors.
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.

#### <a name="step5">Step 5: Assessor Conducts Hearing and Makes Determination</a> <a href="#s5" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

<u>Where Notice for Repricing is lodged</u>

Where the Other Party or his assignee has lodged a Notice for Repricing and they are acknowledged by the Registrar, the Registrar will appoint an Assessor(s) to make a determination on the Other Party’s Notice for Repricing. 

<u>Mode of Hearing</u>

The hearing will generally be conducted <u>over email</u>. The Assessor(s) may request for clarifications or further documents by email.

If the Assessor(s) is of the opinion that the interest of justice would be better served by an <u>online or physical hearing</u>:

* Online hearings will be conducted via Webex.
* Physical hearings will be held at a venue to be advised by the Registrar.

Please note for online or physical hearings:

* The Assessor(s) may permit a party to be accompanied by an interpreter at the hearing. The party will be responsible for sourcing their own interpreter.
* No party may be represented by an advocate and solicitor at proceedings before Assessor(s).

If a party to the contract or his assignee is <u>absent</u> from the hearing, the Assessor(s) may deem that that party (or that party’s assignee) has withdrawn the Notice lodged by him; or may proceed to hear and make a determination on the case.

If a person had a good reason for being absent, he may make an application to set aside the determination made in their absence. See [here](/realign/assessor-determinations).

#### <a name="step6">Step 6: Registrar Informs Affected Business and Other Party of Assessor’s Determination</a> <a href="#s6" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

After the Assessor(s) has made a determination, the Registrar will inform the Affected Business, the Other Party, and their assignees.

There is no appeal against an Assessor’s determination, and it will be binding on all parties to the contract and their assignees.

The Registrar may publish the facts of the case, the arguments and the determination without disclosing the names of the parties concerned or any information that may disclose their identities.

#### <a name="step6a">Withdrawal of Notice for Repricing</a> <a href="#s6a" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

Where an Affected Business who has lodged and served a Notice for Repricing wishes to withdraw that Notice, the Affected Business must lodge a Notice of Withdrawal with the Registrar and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the following Recipient(s) where applicable.

* The Other Party; 
* Any other party to the contract; and
* Any assignee to any party to the contract. 

The Notice of Withdrawal must be lodged and served before the Assessor(s) makes a determination concerning the repricing of the contract. 

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u>

To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you must have an email address as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):

*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
