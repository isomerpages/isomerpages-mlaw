### <a name="1eligiblity">Eligibility Criteria</a> <a href="#s1" title="Return to top">↩</a> ###

To be eligible for any type of relief under the Re-Align Framework (“the Framework”):

(a) A business’ annual revenue must not exceed S$30 million at a global group level; and

(b) That business must have experienced at least a 70% fall in monthly average gross income for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 November 2020, compared to the period 1 July 2020 to 30 November 2019.

If you commenced business on or after 1 July 2019, please refer to here <hyperlink to PDF> for the equivalent comparison periods by which the decrease in monthly average gross income may be computed.

<u>Individuals (e.g. freelancers) / Non-Profit Organisations</u>

The Framework covers individuals carrying on business or trade (e.g. freelancers) and non-profit organisations (e.g. registered or exempt charities, co-operative societies, arts and culture societies, trade associations) if they satisfy the above criteria. 

### <a name="2Renegotiation">Renegotiation of Contractual Terms and Termination of Contract</a> <a href="#s2" title="Return to top">↩</a> ###

The Framework allows eligible small and micro businesses (including individuals and non-profit organisations) to renegotiate and rebase their contracts, failing which the contracts may be terminated with prospective obligations extinguished. The Framework provides for default terms to apply when a contract is terminated under the Framework. Details of these terms of termination under the Re-Align Framework can be found here. <hyperlink to PDF of infographic>

If there is a dispute over the eligibility of a business for the Framework, or the parties are unable to agree on the terms of termination under the Framework, such disputes may be resolved by an Adjustment Relief Assessor (“Assessor”).  

<u>Contracts covered for renegotiation and termination relief</u>

The Framework applies to a contract (including Government contracts) which meet the following conditions:

(a) Is governed by Singapore law;

(b) Was entered into before 25 March 2020;

(c) Has at least one party who has a place of business in Singapore; and

(d) Falls within the following categories (“Specified Contracts”), which are likely to have substantial obligations that may need renegotiation or restructuring:

* Leases or licences for non-residential immovable property which have a term of 5 or less years
* Hire-purchase and conditional sales agreements for commercial equipment or vehicles (except agreements entered into with banks and finance companies regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore)
* Rental agreements for commercial equipment or vehicles
* Contracts for sale and purchase of goods and services.  

Certain contracts will be excluded from the Re-Align Framework, even if they fall within the list of Specified Contracts (“**Excluded Contracts**”). These are:

* Consumer contracts
* Employment contracts
* Insurance contracts
* Leases or licences for non-residential immovable property which have a term of more than five years
* Contracts made in connection with a financial transaction, or for the supply of financial services (e.g. loan agreements, insurance agreements, commodities contracts, derivatives contracts, factoring contracts), except hire-purchase
* Construction and supply contracts
* Contracts for the carriage of goods for freight by sea, land or air, including any contract for freight forwarding and logistic services
* Contracts for the supply, storage, transportation, collection, treatment or disposal of certain hazardous materials
* Contracts (or series of contracts) for the transfer for a business or part thereof as a going concern
* Contracts to which section 4 of the International Interests in Aircraft Equipment Act (Cap. 144B) apply
* Contracts to which the Sale of Goods (United Nations Convention) Act (Cap. 283A) apply 

An eligible party to a Contract Affecting Essential Services and National Interest may not terminate the contract under the Re-Align Framework if certain conditions are met but may renegotiate the pricing of the contract.

<u>How to apply</u>

If you think you are eligible, please serve the **Notice for Negotiation** on the other party to the contract and other required parties **<u>by no later than 25 January 2021</u>**. 

If you wish to object to a Notice of Negotiation served on you, you may serve and lodge a **Notice of Objection** within the specified time, following which your objection will be determined by an Assessor. 

If the parties do not dispute the termination under the Framework but are unable to agree on the consequences of termination, either party may serve and lodge a **Notice of Adjustment** within the specified time to seek an Assessor’s determination.

However, a party to a **Contract of National Interest** may still seek a renegotiation of the price of the contract by serving a **Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest** on the other party or parties to the contract.
