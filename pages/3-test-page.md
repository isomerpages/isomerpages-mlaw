(a)	a hirer under a hire-purchase or conditional sales agreement for commercial equipment; or commercial vehicle, which is not entered into with a bank, or with a finance company under the Finance Companies Act (Cap. 108); or

(b)	a renter under a rental agreement for commercial equipment or commercial vehicle 

The Notice of Revision must be served within 6 weeks from 14 December 2020 (i.e. by 25 January 2021), on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:
* The Claimant’s financing company or leasing company, as the case may be (“the Counterparty”).

##### Moratorium #####
To facilitate negotiations and to avoid parallel proceedings on the same matter, once a Claimant serves a Notice of Revision, the Counterparty will be prohibited from taking legal and enforcement actions (e.g. court and arbitration proceedings, or termination of the contract) against the Claimant for his non-payment of any amount mentioned in section 53(4)(a) of the Act or any interest or other charge (however described) on that amount.

Broadly, the prohibition will end on the earliest of the following: 

(a) On the expiry of 6 weeks after the Notice of Revision is served, if a Notice of Objection is not served and lodged.

(b) If a Notice of Objection is validly served and lodged within the 6 weeks, the day on which the Notice of Objection is withdrawn after the expiry of the 6 weeks. 

(c) The day on which an Assessor has made all the determinations required to be made in relation to the Notice of Revision. 


For more details on the moratorium, please refer to the [Fifth Schedule of the Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/37-2020/Published/20201116?DocDate=20201116){:target="_blank"}.  

#### <a name="step2">Step 2: Claimant and Counterparty renegotiate contract during 4-week Negotiation Period</a> <a href="#s2" title="Return to top">↩</a>####

From the date of the Notice of Revision, there will be a **4-week Negotiation Period** during which the Claimant and the Counterparty are encouraged to renegotiate the repayment schedule for any outstanding payments owed by the Claimant to the Counterparty, or the terms of the contract, where applicable. 

During this Negotiation Period, the Counterparty cannot file a Notice of Objection. 

#### <a name="step3">Step 3: Counterparty lodges and serves Notice of Objection during the 2-week Objection Period</a> <a href="#s3" title="Return to top">↩</a>####
At the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, the two possible outcomes are: 
* Parties have successfully renegotiated the terms of their contract and/or the repayment schedule for outstanding payments. 
* Parties have been unsuccessful in their renegotiation of the terms of their contract and/or the repayment schedule for outstanding payments. 

A **2-week Objection Period** starts after the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**. 

If parties have successfully renegotiated the terms of their contract by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, they may proceed with the amended terms of their contract or the amended repayment schedule. The Counterparty does not need to serve a Notice of Objection in this situation. 

In contrast, where parties are unsuccessful in their renegotiation by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, there are two courses of action for the Counterparty or his assignee.


##### <a name="step3a">(A): Counterparty objects to Claimant’s Notice of Revision</a> <a href="#3a" title="Return to top">↩</a>#####
If the Counterparty or his assignee wishes to object to the Claimant’s Notice of Revision, he or she must, within the **2-week Objection Period**, serve a Notice of Objection on the required parties, and lodge the Notice of Objection with the Adjustment Relief Registrar within the same period. 

The Counterparty or his assignee may <u>only</u> object to the Claimant’s Notice of Revision on any one or more of the following grounds:

* The contract in question is not a hire-purchase or conditional sales agreement or a lease of commercial equipment. 
* the Claimant does not satisfy the eligibility criteria for relief.
* the Notice of Revision was not served in accordance with Section 53 of the Act.
* The Claimant’s proposed repayment schedule does not meet the requirements in Section 53(4)(a)-(d) of the Act. 

To object to the Notice of Revision, the Counterparty must lodge the Notice of Objection with the Registrar and serve the Notice of Objection on the following persons **within the 2-week Objection Period** on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:
* The Claimant;
* Any other party to the contract;
* The Claimant’s guarantor or surety, or issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract; and
*	Any assignee of any party to the contract. 


<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u> 

To submit to the Registrar and serve the **Notice of Objection** on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you must have an email address as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):

* If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
* If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).

##### <a name="step3b">(B): Counterparty does not object to Claimant’s Notice of Revision</a> <a href="#3b" title="Return to top">↩</a>#####
Where the Counterparty accepts the Claimant’s Notice of Revision, the parties can carry out their repayment obligations according to the revised repayment schedule in the Notice of Revision. The Counterparty does not need to serve and lodge a Notice of Objection in this situation.  

If no Notice of Objection is served and lodged during the **2-week Objection Period**, the Claimant’s revised repayment schedule will form part of the contract from the date of the Notice of Revision and will prevail over any term of the contract which is inconsistent with the revised repayment schedule. 

Please also note that there will be no case before an Assessor in this situation. **Steps 4 to 6** below will **<u>not</u>** apply.


#### <a name="step4">Step 4: Registrar reviews Notice of Objection</a> <a href="#s4" title="Return to top">↩</a>####
The Registrar will review the Notice of Objection.

If the Registrar is satisfied that the Notice of Objection is in order, the Registrar will send to the Claimant, the Counterparty and their assignees by way of email:
* An acknowledgment of receipt of the Notice of Objection.
* A notice of the appointment of one or more Assessors.
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.

If the Registrar refuses to accept lodgment of a Notice of Objection or the Notice of Objection is withdrawn by the Counterparty, the Claimant’s revised repayment schedule will form part of the contract from the date of the Notice of Revision and will prevail over any term of the contract which is inconsistent with the revised repayment schedule.

#### <a name="step5">Step 5: Assessor Conducts Hearing and Makes Determination</a> <a href="#s5" title="Return to top">↩</a>####
<u>Where Notice of Objection is lodged</u> 

Where the Counterparty or his assignee has lodged a Notice of Objection and they are acknowledged by the Registrar, the Registrar will appoint an Assessor(s) to make a determination on the Counterparty’s Notice of Objection. 

If the Counterparty’s Notice of Objection is dismissed by the Assessor(s), the Claimant’s revised repayment schedule will form part of the contract from the date of the Notice of Revision and will prevail over any term of the contract which is inconsistent with the revised repayment schedule.

<u>Mode of hearing</u>

The hearing will generally be conducted <u>over email</u>. The Assessor(s) may request for clarifications or further documents by email.
If the Assessor(s) is of the opinion that the interest of justice would be better served by an <u>online or physical hearing</u>:
* Online hearings will be conducted via Webex.
* Physical hearings will be held at a venue to be advised by the Registrar.

Please note for online or physical hearings:
* The Assessor(s) may permit a party to be accompanied by an interpreter at the hearing. The party will be responsible for sourcing their own interpreter.
* No party may be represented by an advocate and solicitor at proceedings before Assessor(s).

If a party to a determination is <u>absent</u> from the hearing, the Assessor(s) may deem that the party (or that party’s assignee who was absent) has withdrawn the Notice lodged by him; or make a determination on the case.

If the party had a good reason for being absent, they may make an application to set aside the determination made in their absence. See here <hyperlink >.

#### <a name="step6">Step 6: Registrar Informs Claimant and Counterparty of Assessor’s Determination</a> <a href="#s6" title="Return to top">↩</a>####
After the Assessor(s) has made a determination, the Registrar will inform the Claimant, the Counterparty and their assignees.

There is no appeal against an Assessor’s determination, and it will be binding on all parties to the contract and their assignees.

The Registrar may publish the facts of the case, the arguments and the determination without disclosing the names of the parties concerned or any information that may disclose their identities.

##### <a name="step6a">Withdrawal of Notice of Objection</a> <a href="#6a" title="Return to top">↩</a>##### 
Where any party who has lodged and served a Notice of Objection wishes to withdraw that Notice, that party must lodge a Notice of Withdrawal with the Registrar and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the following Recipient(s) where applicable. 

|**Type of Notice you are withdrawing** | **Recipients(s) whom you must serve the Notice of Withdrawal**
| Notice of Objection (s. 55) | - The party who served the Notice of Revision on you; <br>-The other parties to the contract; and <br>-Any assignee to any party to the contract.

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u>

To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you must have an email address as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):
* If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
* If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).

***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

Please note if you have lodged and/or served more than one Notice of Objection, you must lodge and serve the Notice of Withdrawal for <u>each</u> of the Notices you wish to withdraw.
