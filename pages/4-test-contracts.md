#### Step 1: Claimant serves Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest ####

An **<u>eligible party</u>** <hyperlink to (1) Key Features of Re-Align Framework>  to a Contract of National Interest who wishes to renegotiate the price of the contract must serve a Notice of Negotiation for Contract of National Interest (“the Claimant”) on the following Recipient(s), where applicable:

* Any other party to the contract (“the Counterparty”).
* The Claimant’s guarantor or surety, or the issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract.
* Any assignee of any party to the contract.  

**<u>Service by the electronic system</u>**

#### Step 2:  Claimant and Counterparty renegotiate contract during 4-week Negotiation Period ####

From the date of the Notice of Negotiation for Contract for National Interest, there will be a **4-week Negotiation Period** during which the Claimant and the Counterparty are encouraged to renegotiate the price of the contract.

During this Negotiation Period, the Counterparty cannot file a Notice of Repricing. 

#### Step 3: End of Negotiation Period and Start of Repricing Period ####

At the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, the two possible outcomes are:

* Parties have successfully renegotiated the price of their contract.
* Parties have been unsuccessful in their renegotiation of the price of their contract. 

A **2-week Repricing Period** starts after the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**.

If parties have successfully renegotiated the price of their contract by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, they may proceed with the amended price of their contract. The Claimant does not need to serve a Notice for Repricing in this situation. 

In contrast, where parties are unsuccessful in their renegotiation by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period** and Claimant wishes to seek a repricing of the contract, the Claimant must, within the **2-week Repricing Period** lodge the Notice for Repricing with the Adjustment Relief Registrar, and serve a Notice for Repricing within the same period on the following Recipient(s), where applicable: 

* The Counterparty.
* Any other party to the contract;
* The Claimant’s guarantor or surety, or issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract; and
* Any assignee of any party to the contract. 

**<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u>**

To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice for Repricing on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system (if you have an email address, and have the email address(es) of the Recipient(s)):

*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
*	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).
