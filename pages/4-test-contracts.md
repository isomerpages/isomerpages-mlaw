#### <a name="step2">Step 2:  Claimant and Counterparty renegotiate contract during 4-week Negotiation Period</a> <a href="#s2" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

From the date of the Notice of Negotiation for Contract for National Interest, there will be a **4-week Negotiation Period** during which the Claimant and the Counterparty are encouraged to renegotiate the price of the contract.

During this Negotiation Period, the Counterparty cannot file a Notice of Repricing. 

#### <a name="step3">Step 3: End of Negotiation Period and Start of Repricing Period<a name="step1"> <a href="#s3" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

At the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, the two possible outcomes are:

* Parties have successfully renegotiated the price of their contract.
* Parties have been unsuccessful in their renegotiation of the price of their contract. 

A **2-week Repricing Period** starts after the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**.

If parties have successfully renegotiated the price of their contract by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period**, they may proceed with the amended price of their contract. The Claimant does not need to serve a Notice for Repricing in this situation. 

In contrast, where parties are unsuccessful in their renegotiation by the end of the **4-week Negotiation Period** and Claimant wishes to seek a repricing of the contract, the Claimant must, within the **2-week Repricing Period** lodge the Notice for Repricing with the Adjustment Relief Registrar, and serve a Notice for Repricing within the same period on the following Recipient(s), where applicable: 

* The Counterparty.
* Any other party to the contract;
* The Claimant’s guarantor or surety, or issuer of a performance bond, in relation to the Claimant’s obligations under the contract; and
* Any assignee of any party to the contract. 

**<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u>**

To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice for Repricing on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system (if you have an email address, and have the email address(es) of the Recipient(s)):

*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
*	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass).

#### <a name="step4">Step 4: Case proceeds to an Assessor</a> <a href="#s4" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

The Registrar will review the Notice for Repricing.

If the Registrar is satisfied that the Notice for Repricing is in order, the Registrar will send to the Claimant, the Counterparty and their assignees by way of email:

* An acknowledgment of receipt of the Notice.
* A notice of the appointment of one or more Assessors.
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.

#### <a name="step5">Step 5: Assessor Conducts Hearing and Makes Determination</a> <a href="#s5" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

<u>Where Notice for Repricing is lodged</u>

Where the Counterparty or his assignee has lodged a Notice for Repricing and they are acknowledged by the Registrar, the Registrar will appoint an Assessor(s) to make a determination on the Counterparty’s Notice for Repricing. 

<u>Mode of Hearing</u>

The hearing will generally be conducted <u>over email</u>. The Assessor(s) may request for clarifications or further documents by email.

If the Assessor(s) is of the opinion that the interest of justice would be better served by an <u>online or physical hearing</u>:

* Online hearings will be conducted via Webex.
* Physical hearings will be held at a venue to be advised by the Registrar.

Please note for online or physical hearings:

* The Assessor(s) may permit a party to be accompanied by an interpreter at the hearing. The party will be responsible for sourcing their own interpreter.
* No party may be represented by an advocate and solicitor at proceedings before Assessor(s).

If a party to a determination is <u>absent</u> from the hearing, the Assessor(s) may deem that the party (or that party’s assignee who was absent) has withdrawn the Notice lodged by him; or make a determination on the case.

If the party had a good reason for being absent, they may make an application to set aside the determination made in their absence. See here <hyperlink to (6) Assessor’s Determinations>

#### <a name="step6">Step 6: Registrar Informs Claimant and Counterparty of Assessor’s Determination</a> <a href="#s6" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

After the Assessor(s) has made a determination, the Registrar will inform the Claimant, the Counterparty, and their assignees.

There is no appeal against an Assessor’s determination, and it will be binding on all parties to the contract and their assignees.

The Registrar may publish the facts of the case, the arguments and the determination without disclosing the names of the parties concerned or any information that may disclose their identities.

#### <a name="step6a">Withdrawal of Notice of Repricing</a> <a href="#s6a" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

Where any party who has lodged and served a Notice for Repricing wishes to withdraw that Notice, that party must lodge a Notice of Withdrawal with the Registrar and serve the Notice of Withdrawal on the following Recipient(s) where applicable.

|**Type of Notice you are withdrawing** | **Recipients(s) whom you must serve the Notice of Withdrawal**
| Notice for Repricing (s. 62) | -The other parties to the contract; and <br>-Any assignee to any party to the contract.

<u>Submission and service by the electronic system</u>

To submit to the Registrar and serve the Notice for Repricing on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system, you must have an email address as well as the email address(es) of the Recipient(s):

*	If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this link* (CorpPass).
*	If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this link* (SingPass). 

***IMPORTANT NOTE: These links will only be available from 14 December 2020 onwards**

Please note if you have lodged and/or served more than one Notice for Repricing, you must lodge and serve the Notice of Withdrawal for <u>each</u> of the Notices you wish to withdraw.

#### <a name="faq">FAQs</a> <a href="#f1" title="Return to top">↩</a> ####

**1. Can the Assessor adjust anything else other than the price of the contract? For example, the length of the contract?**

No. The Assessor is only empowered to adjust the price of the contract.

**2. What will the Assessor take into account when repricing the contract?**

The Assessor will take into account all relevant factors, including the changed business environment of the parties, in determining the price to be applied to the contract.
