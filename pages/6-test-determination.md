### Assessors’ Determination are binding, non-appealable and are enforceable with Court’s leave ###
Determinations by the Adjustment Relief Assessor are binding on all parties and their assignees and are **not appealable**. 

Such determinations may, with leave of the Court, be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or an order of Court. Please seek legal advice on how you may enforce the determination. 

A person, who without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with any determination binding on the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction.

### Application to Set Aside an Assessor’s Determination ###
